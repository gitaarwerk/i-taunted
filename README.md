## But, it's what WeakAuras can do as well, right?
Sure, WeakAuras provides a lot more. It's awesome! But... It is also a lot more complex, and takes up way more resources. This is simple, effective, and doesn't put a lot of toll on the system. It's plug and play!

## Features
* Player adds a message in plain message chat, including raid target icon when available
* Supports most tank-classess taunts (including multiple strengths or talent improved versions), pets and engineering trinkets
* Only works inside raids
* AoE/Mass taunts are limited to cast when a target is successfully taunted, and has a cooldown of 8 hard seconds to prevent spam.
